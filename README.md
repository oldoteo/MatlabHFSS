# MatlabHFSS
Set of Matlab functions to performs various tasks in Ansys Electronics Desktop (HFSS), such as drawing coupled microstrip circuits and filters, setting up simulation, ports and graphs.

Run the hfsscoupledmicrostrips script in Matlab (on a computer with a valid Ansys Electronics Desktop license) to see it in action.
Edit the first lines of parameters to alter the geometry.

The ancillary functions do the basic operations in HFSS via API, which you can use to achieve other operations in HFSS still Matlab driven.
